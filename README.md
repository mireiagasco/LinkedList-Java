# Implementation of a Doubly LinkedList with a point of interest using Java
A doubly linked list is a common type of list that is build with nodes that contain the data, a reference to the previous node and a reference to the next node in the list.  The list itself usually consists of two references to the initial and final nodes of the list.  In this implementation, an additional reference is added: the PDI (point of interest).  This reference points to one of the elements of the list and serves as the default position to add and remove elements from the list.  This functionality is explained exhaustively below.
